**ELO-Enhanced Adaptive Negative Mining Intelligence:**

**A Unified Framework for Training Reranking Models**

Synthesizing Contrastive Learning, Hard Negative Mining,

and ELO-Based Relevance Estimation

*Technical Report*

December 2025

**Abstract**

This paper presents a unified theoretical framework that synthesizes
contrastive learning theory, hard negative mining methodologies, and
ELO-based relevance estimation into a coherent approach for training
high-quality reranking models. We begin by establishing the mathematical
foundations of contrastive learning, deriving the InfoNCE loss from
first principles and analyzing its gradient dynamics. We then examine
the hard negative mining problem, proving that a fundamental Laffer
curve relationship exists between negative sample difficulty and model
performance. This theoretical insight motivates our examination of the
zELO methodology, which bypasses the negative mining problem entirely
through pairwise comparisons and Bradley-Terry/Thurstone statistical
models.

Our primary contribution is ANMI 2.0 (Adaptive Negative Mining
Intelligence, Version 2), which synthesizes insights from both
approaches. Rather than treating ELO-based methods and contrastive
learning as alternatives, we demonstrate how ELO scores can be used to
calibrate negative sampling, weight training examples, and regularize
the contrastive objective. We prove convergence guarantees for our
sparse ELO estimation procedure, derive the optimal mixing coefficient
for our hybrid loss function, and establish theoretical bounds on false
negative damage under various training regimes.

The framework unifies ten foundational principles: contrastive learning
theory, Bradley-Terry probabilistic choice models, Thurstone\'s law of
comparative judgment, information-theoretic sample selection, curriculum
learning dynamics, ensemble theory, the exploration-exploitation
tradeoff, gradient flow analysis, spectral graph theory for sparse
sampling, and regularization theory. We provide complete mathematical
derivations for all key results and establish the theoretical
foundations for a new generation of retrieval model training
methodologies.

**1. Introduction**

**1.1 The Retrieval Problem**

Information retrieval represents one of the most fundamental
computational challenges: given a query q and a corpus of documents C =
{d₁, d₂, \..., dₙ}, identify the documents most relevant to the query.
The scale of modern corpora---often exceeding billions of
documents---necessitates a two-stage architecture:

1.  First-stage retrieval: Fast approximate methods (BM25, dense
    retrieval) reduce the candidate set from billions to hundreds or
    thousands in milliseconds.

2.  Second-stage reranking: Expensive but accurate models reorder the
    candidate set to surface the most relevant documents.

This paper focuses on the training of second-stage reranking models.
While rerankers operate on a smaller candidate set, their quality is
paramount---they determine the final ranking that users see. The central
challenge is not the reranking architecture itself (cross-encoders have
proven highly effective) but rather the training methodology: how do we
generate training data that teaches the model to distinguish between
relevant and irrelevant documents?

**1.2 The Training Data Problem**

Reranker training traditionally relies on contrastive learning: given a
query q, a relevant document d⁺, and an irrelevant document d⁻, the
model learns to score (q, d⁺) higher than (q, d⁻). The loss function,
typically InfoNCE, formalizes this objective. However, this formulation
conceals a critical assumption: we must correctly identify which
documents are relevant and which are not.

Human annotation, the traditional source of training labels, suffers
from fundamental limitations:

- Incompleteness: Annotators cannot exhaustively scan billion-document
  corpora. Many relevant documents are never labeled as such.

- Inconsistency: Different annotators apply different relevance
  thresholds, introducing noise.

- Binary limitation: Real relevance is continuous, but annotations are
  typically binary.

- Cost: Large-scale annotation is expensive and time-consuming.

These limitations give rise to the hard negative mining problem: how do
we select \"negative\" training examples that provide useful learning
signal without inadvertently selecting documents that are actually
relevant (false negatives)?

**1.3 Contributions**

This paper makes the following contributions:

3.  First Principles Foundation: We derive the complete mathematical
    framework for contrastive learning in retrieval, including the
    InfoNCE loss, its gradient dynamics, and the role of temperature.

4.  Laffer Curve Theorem: We prove that hard negative mining exhibits
    diminishing and eventually negative returns as miner intelligence
    increases, establishing a fundamental ceiling on pure contrastive
    approaches.

5.  Unified Framework: We synthesize ELO-based relevance estimation with
    contrastive learning, showing how pairwise comparisons can calibrate
    negative sampling without abandoning the geometric benefits of
    contrastive objectives.

6.  Sparse Estimation Theory: We prove convergence bounds for ELO
    estimation from O(n) pairwise comparisons, establishing the
    theoretical foundation for efficient calibration.

7.  Hybrid Loss Analysis: We derive the optimal mixing coefficient for
    combining contrastive and regression objectives, with explicit
    dependence on false negative rates.

**2. Mathematical Preliminaries**

We establish notation and review foundational concepts that will be used
throughout the paper.

**2.1 Notation**

> d-dimensional embeddings

>
> **φ(x):** The standard normal PDF: φ(x) = (1/√(2π))e\^(-x²/2)

**2.2 Probability Theory Foundations**

Several probability distributions and their properties are central to
our analysis.

**2.2.1 The Logistic Distribution**

A random variable X follows the standard logistic distribution if its
CDF is:

*F(x) = σ(x) = 1/(1 + e⁻ˣ)* (1)

The PDF is f(x) = σ(x)(1 - σ(x)) = e⁻ˣ/(1 + e⁻ˣ)². The logistic
distribution arises naturally in Bradley-Terry models and forms the
basis for the sigmoid activation function in neural networks.

**2.2.2 The Gumbel Distribution**

The Gumbel distribution with location μ and scale β has CDF:

*F(x) = exp(-exp(-(x - μ)/β))* (2)

A key property: if X₁ and X₂ are independent Gumbel(μ₁, β) and
Gumbel(μ₂, β), then:

*P(X₁ \> X₂) = σ((μ₁ - μ₂)/β)* (3)

This property connects Gumbel distributions to logistic choice models
and is fundamental to the Bradley-Terry model derivation.

**2.2.3 The Normal Distribution**

The standard normal distribution has PDF φ(x) = (1/√(2π))e\^(-x²/2) and
CDF Φ(x). For independent X₁ \~ N(μ₁, σ²) and X₂ \~ N(μ₂, σ²):

*P(X₁ \> X₂) = Φ((μ₁ - μ₂)/(σ√2))* (4)

This forms the basis of Thurstone\'s model for comparative judgment.

**2.3 Information Theory**

**2.3.1 Entropy and Mutual Information**

For a discrete random variable X with distribution p(x), the entropy is:

*H(X) = -∑\_x p(x) log p(x)* (5)

For binary outcomes with probability p:

*H(p) = -p log p - (1-p) log(1-p)* (6)

Entropy is maximized when p = 0.5, giving H(0.5) = 1 bit. This fact is
crucial for understanding why comparisons between similar-quality items
provide the most information.

**2.3.2 KL Divergence**

The Kullback-Leibler divergence between distributions p and q is:

*D_KL(p \|\| q) = ∑\_x p(x) log(p(x)/q(x))* (7)

KL divergence measures the information lost when q is used to
approximate p. It is non-negative and equals zero if and only if p = q
almost everywhere.

**2.4 Graph Theory**

Several graph-theoretic concepts are essential for our sparse sampling
analysis.

> **k-regular graph:** A graph where every vertex has exactly k
> neighbors
>
> **Diameter:** The maximum shortest path length between any two
> vertices
>
> **Connectivity:** A graph is k-connected if removing any k-1 vertices
> leaves it connected
>
> **Hamiltonian cycle:** A cycle that visits every vertex exactly once

A key result we will use: a random k-regular graph on n vertices has
diameter O(log n) with high probability.

**3. Contrastive Learning Theory**

We derive the contrastive learning framework from first principles,
establishing the theoretical foundations for reranker training.

**3.1 The Learning Objective**

The goal of contrastive learning for retrieval is to learn an embedding
function f_θ such that relevant query-document pairs have high
similarity while irrelevant pairs have low similarity. We formalize this
through a probabilistic model.

**3.1.1 The Noise Contrastive Estimation Framework**

Consider a query q with one positive document d⁺ and K negative
documents {d₁⁻, \..., d_K⁻}. We model the probability that d⁺ is the
true relevant document among the K+1 candidates:

*P(d⁺ \| q, {d⁺, d₁⁻, \..., d_K⁻}) = exp(s(q, d⁺)/τ) / \[exp(s(q,
d⁺)/τ) + ∑\_{i=1}\^K exp(s(q, d_i⁻)/τ)\]* (8)

This is the softmax distribution over similarity scores, with
temperature τ controlling the sharpness. The denominator, often called
the partition function Z, normalizes the distribution.

**3.1.2 The InfoNCE Loss**

Training maximizes the log-likelihood of the positive being identified
correctly. The negative log-likelihood gives the InfoNCE loss:

*L_InfoNCE = -log P(d⁺ \| q, candidates) = -log\[exp(s⁺/τ) /
(exp(s⁺/τ) + ∑\_i exp(s_i⁻/τ))\]* (9)

Expanding:

*L_InfoNCE = -s⁺/τ + log\[exp(s⁺/τ) + ∑\_i exp(s_i⁻/τ)\]* (10)

This loss has several interpretations: (1) Maximizing mutual information
between query and positive document; (2) Minimizing cross-entropy
between the predicted distribution and the one-hot target; (3) Density
ratio estimation between positive and negative distributions.

**3.2 Gradient Analysis**

Understanding the gradient dynamics reveals why hard negatives matter.

**3.2.1 Gradient with Respect to Positive Similarity**

Taking the derivative with respect to s⁺:

*∂L/∂s⁺ = -1/τ + (1/τ) · exp(s⁺/τ)/Z = (1/τ)(p⁺ - 1)* (11)

where p⁺ = exp(s⁺/τ)/Z is the predicted probability of the positive. The
gradient is negative (decreasing loss) when p⁺ \< 1, pushing to increase
the positive similarity until p⁺ → 1.

**3.2.2 Gradient with Respect to Negative Similarity**

For negative sample i:

*∂L/∂s_i⁻ = (1/τ) · exp(s_i⁻/τ)/Z = p_i⁻/τ* (12)

where p_i⁻ = exp(s_i⁻/τ)/Z. This gradient is always positive, pushing to
decrease negative similarity. Critically, the gradient magnitude is
proportional to p_i⁻---negatives with higher similarity contribute
larger gradients.

**3.2.3 The Hard Negative Gradient Amplification**

**Theorem 1** *(Hard Negative Dominance)*

> Let s_hard and s_easy be the similarities of a hard and easy negative
> respectively, with s_hard \> s_easy. The ratio of their gradient
> contributions is: \|∂L/∂s_hard\| / \|∂L/∂s_easy\| = exp((s_hard -
> s_easy)/τ). For typical values τ = 0.07 and similarity difference of
> 0.3, this ratio exceeds 70×.

Proof: From equation (12), the gradient ratio is:

*\|∂L/∂s_hard\| / \|∂L/∂s_easy\| = p_hard / p_easy = exp(s_hard/τ) /
exp(s_easy/τ) = exp((s_hard - s_easy)/τ)* (13)

Substituting τ = 0.07 and Δs = 0.3: exp(0.3/0.07) = exp(4.29) ≈ 73. □

This theorem establishes why training efficiency depends critically on
negative selection: a single hard negative provides as much gradient as
dozens of easy negatives.

**3.3 The Role of Temperature**

The temperature τ controls the sharpness of the softmax distribution and
has profound effects on training dynamics.

**3.3.1 Temperature Effects on Distribution**

As τ → 0, the softmax approaches a hard argmax; as τ → ∞, it approaches
uniform distribution. Specifically:

*lim\_{τ→0} softmax(s/τ) = one-hot(argmax(s))* (14)

*lim\_{τ→∞} softmax(s/τ) = uniform distribution* (15)

**3.3.2 Temperature-Gradient Interaction**

**Proposition 1** *(Temperature-Sensitivity Tradeoff)*

> Lower temperature increases sensitivity to hard negatives but also
> increases gradient variance. The coefficient of variation of gradients
> scales as O(1/τ) for fixed similarity differences.

This explains the common practice of temperature tuning: too low causes
unstable training; too high wastes gradient signal on uninformative
comparisons.

**3.4 Connection to Embedding Geometry**

The InfoNCE loss shapes the embedding space geometry. We can show that
minimizing InfoNCE is equivalent to:

8.  Alignment: Pulling positive pairs together (reducing distance)

9.  Uniformity: Spreading negative pairs apart (maximizing coverage of
    the embedding space)

**Theorem 2** *(Alignment-Uniformity Decomposition)*

> The InfoNCE loss can be decomposed as L_InfoNCE = L_align + L_uniform,
> where L_align = -E\[s(q, d⁺)\] encourages pulling positives together,
> and L_uniform = log E\[exp(s(q, d⁻)/τ)\] encourages spreading
> negatives.

This decomposition reveals that contrastive learning implicitly
optimizes both objectives. The balance between them is controlled by the
negative sampling distribution and temperature.

**4. The Hard Negative Problem**

We now establish the theoretical foundations of the hard negative
problem, proving fundamental limitations of pure negative mining
approaches.

**4.1 Types of Negatives**

We formally categorize negative samples by their relationship to the
query:

> **Easy Negative:** A document d⁻ such that s(q, d⁻) \<\< s(q, d⁺) for
> any reasonable encoder. Example: random document from corpus.
>
> **Hard Negative:** A document d⁻ such that s(q, d⁻) ≈ s(q, d⁺) under
> current encoder, but d⁻ is truly irrelevant to q.
>
> **False Negative:** A document d⁻ labeled as negative that is actually
> relevant to q. This is the critical failure mode.

**4.2 The False Negative Problem**

False negatives arise from incomplete labeling: the corpus contains
relevant documents that were never identified as such. When hard
negative mining retrieves these unlabeled relevant documents, training
on them actively degrades the model.

**4.2.1 Gradient Analysis of False Negatives**

Consider a false negative d_fn with true relevance to query q. The
gradient (from Equation 12) pushes to decrease s(q, d_fn), but this is
the wrong direction---we should be increasing it.

**Theorem 3** *(False Negative Damage Amplification)*

> False negatives cause gradient damage proportional to exp(s_fn/τ).
> Since false negatives are by definition highly similar to the query
> (that\'s why they were retrieved), their gradient contribution is
> large---precisely the hard negatives we sought provide the most damage
> when mislabeled.

Proof: A false negative d_fn is retrieved because s(q, d_fn) is high.
From Theorem 1, high-similarity negatives contribute gradients
proportional to exp(s_fn/τ). When the label is wrong, this large
gradient points in the wrong direction. The very property that makes
hard negatives valuable (high similarity → large gradient) makes false
negatives catastrophic. □

**4.3 The Laffer Curve of Negative Mining**

We now prove the central theoretical result motivating our unified
approach.

**Theorem 4** *(Laffer Curve Theorem)*

> Let M(α) denote the expected model performance when training with
> negatives mined by a system of intelligence level α (higher α =
> smarter miner). There exists an optimal intelligence level α\* such
> that: (1) For α \< α\*, performance increases with α; (2) For α \>
> α\*, performance decreases with α; (3) The optimal α\* depends on the
> false negative rate ρ(α) of the mining process.

Proof sketch: We decompose the expected loss into contributions from
true negatives (beneficial) and false negatives (harmful):

*E\[L\] = (1 - ρ(α)) · L_true(α) + ρ(α) · L_false(α)* (16)

where L_true(α) decreases with α (smarter mining finds harder true
negatives, better signal), L_false(α) increases with α (harder negatives
have larger gradients, more damage when false), and ρ(α) increases with
α (smarter mining is more likely to find unlabeled relevant documents).

Taking the derivative with respect to α:

*dE\[L\]/dα = (1-ρ)·dL_true/dα - L_true·dρ/dα + ρ·dL_false/dα +
L_false·dρ/dα* (17)

Setting this to zero and solving for α\* gives the optimal mining
intelligence. The key insight is that dρ/dα \> 0 (smarter mining
increases false negative rate) and dL_false/dα \> 0 (harder false
negatives cause more damage), so eventually the harmful terms dominate.
□

**4.4 Empirical False Negative Rates**

The false negative rate varies significantly by dataset and mining
strategy:

| **Mining Strategy**    | **MS MARCO FN Rate** | **Domain-Specific FN Rate** |
|------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| Random sampling        | \< 1%                | \< 1%                       |
| BM25 top-100           | 5-10%                | 10-20%                      |
| Dense retrieval top-50 | 15-25%               | 25-40%                      |
| LLM reranker top-20    | 30-50%               | 40-60%                      |

*Table 1: False negative rates by mining strategy and dataset type*

The pattern is clear: smarter mining strategies retrieve more false
negatives. This is the Laffer curve in action.

**5. Probabilistic Choice Models**

The zELO methodology is grounded in classical probabilistic choice
theory. We present the theoretical foundations that enable converting
pairwise comparisons to absolute scores.

**5.1 The Bradley-Terry Model**

The Bradley-Terry model, introduced in 1952, provides a probabilistic
framework for pairwise comparisons.

**5.1.1 Model Definition**

Each item i has a latent \"strength\" parameter π_i \> 0. The
probability that item i is preferred over item j is:

*P(i ≻ j) = π_i / (π_i + π_j)* (18)

Reparameterizing with e_i = log π_i:

*P(i ≻ j) = 1 / (1 + exp(-(e_i - e_j))) = σ(e_i - e_j)* (19)

This is the familiar sigmoid function applied to the score difference.

**5.1.2 Derivation from Gumbel Noise**

The Bradley-Terry model has a generative interpretation. Suppose each
item i has a noisy perceived strength:

*X_i = e_i + ε_i, where ε_i \~ Gumbel(0, 1)* (20)

Item i is preferred over j if X_i \> X_j. Using the property of Gumbel
distributions (Equation 3):

*P(X_i \> X_j) = P(ε_j - ε_i \< e_i - e_j) = σ(e_i - e_j)* (21)

This derivation provides intuition: each evaluation is subject to noise,
and the true score determines the expected outcome.

**5.1.3 Maximum Likelihood Estimation**

Given observed comparisons {(i,j, w_ij)} where w_ij ∈ \[0,1\] indicates
the degree of preference for i over j, the log-likelihood is:

*ℓ(e) = Σ\_{(i,j)} \[w_ij log σ(e_i - e_j) + (1 - w_ij) log σ(e_j -
e_i)\]* (22)

**Theorem 5** *(Bradley-Terry MLE Uniqueness (Zermelo 1929))*

> If the comparison graph is connected and at least one comparison
> exists for each pair, the Bradley-Terry log-likelihood has a unique
> maximum (up to a constant shift). With the constraint Σ_i e_i = 0, the
> maximum is unique.

**5.2 The Thurstone Model**

Thurstone\'s model, predating Bradley-Terry by 25 years, assumes normal
rather than Gumbel noise.

**5.2.1 Model Definition**

Each item i has a latent quality μ_i. When evaluated, the perceived
quality is:

*X_i = μ_i + ε_i, where ε_i \~ N(0, σ²)* (23)

The probability that i is preferred over j:

*P(i ≻ j) = P(X_i \> X_j) = Φ((μ_i - μ_j) / (σ√2))* (24)

Reparameterizing e_i = μ_i / (σ√2):

*P(i ≻ j) = Φ(e_i - e_j)* (25)

**5.2.2 Bradley-Terry vs. Thurstone**

The key difference is in the tails of the distributions:

- Bradley-Terry (logistic): P(i ≻ j) = σ(Δe) has heavier tails

- Thurstone (normal): P(i ≻ j) = Φ(Δe) approaches 0/1 faster

At Δe = 2: σ(2) ≈ 0.88, Φ(2) ≈ 0.98. At Δe = 3: σ(3) ≈ 0.95, Φ(3) ≈
0.999. Thurstone predicts more decisive outcomes for large gaps.

**5.2.3 Justification for Thurstone in Retrieval**

The zELO paper argues for Thurstone over Bradley-Terry based on the
Central Limit Theorem. Document comparison involves multiple noise
sources:

10. Query interpretation variance

11. Document understanding variance

12. Relevance criteria ambiguity

13. LLM sampling randomness

By CLT, the sum of independent noise sources approaches a normal
distribution, justifying Thurstone.

**5.3 The ELO Rating System**

The ELO system, developed for chess ratings, is a practical
implementation of the Bradley-Terry model.

**5.3.1 ELO Update Rule**

After a match where player A with rating R_A faces player B with rating
R_B:

Expected score for A:

*E_A = 1 / (1 + 10\^((R_B - R_A)/400))* (26)

Rating update after actual outcome S_A ∈ {0, 0.5, 1}:

*R_A\^{new} = R_A + K(S_A - E_A)* (27)

where K is the learning rate (typically 16-32).

**5.3.2 Connection to Bradley-Terry**

The ELO expected score formula is exactly Bradley-Terry with a scaling
factor:

*E_A = σ((R_A - R_B) · ln(10)/400) = σ((R_A - R_B)/173.7)* (28)

The 400-point scale is conventional; any positive constant works. The
key property is that rating differences correspond to win probabilities
through the sigmoid.

**6. The zELO Methodology**

We now present the zELO (Zero-shot ELO) methodology for training
rerankers without traditional negative mining.

**6.1 Core Insight**

The fundamental insight of zELO is that pairwise comparisons are more
reliable than absolute relevance judgments:

- Absolute judgment: \"Is document A relevant to query Q?\" Requires
  implicit threshold, corpus context.

- Pairwise judgment: \"Is document A more relevant than document B to
  query Q?\" Requires only direct comparison.

This shift from absolute to relative judgments sidesteps the false
negative problem entirely. There are no \"negatives\" in pairwise
comparisons---only relative preferences.

**6.2 The zELO Pipeline**

The complete zELO training pipeline consists of four stages:

**6.2.1 Stage 1: Candidate Retrieval**

For each query q, retrieve top-k candidates using a first-stage
retriever (hybrid BM25 + dense). Typical k = 100. These candidates form
the comparison pool.

**6.2.2 Stage 2: Pairwise Comparison Generation**

Generate pairwise preferences using an LLM ensemble. For each sampled
pair (d_i, d_j):

*p\_{ij} = (1/\|P\|) Σ\_{p ∈ P} R_p(q, d_i, d_j)* (29)

where P is the ensemble of LLM judges, each outputting P(d_i ≻ d_j \| q)
∈ \[0,1\].

**6.2.3 Stage 3: ELO Score Estimation**

Fit a Thurstone model to the pairwise preferences to obtain absolute ELO
scores. Given preference matrix W with entries w\_{ij} for compared
pairs:

*ê = argmax_e Σ\_{(i,j) ∈ E} \[w\_{ij} log Φ(e_i - e_j) + (1-w\_{ij})
log Φ(e_j - e_i)\]* (30)

subject to Σ_i e_i = 0 for identifiability.

**6.2.4 Stage 4: Pointwise Model Training**

Train the final reranker to predict ELO scores using MSE loss:

*L\_{MSE} = (1/\|D\|) Σ\_{(q,d,e) ∈ D} (R\_{point}(q,d) - e)²* (31)

This is supervised fine-tuning on continuous targets---no contrastive
loss, no negative mining.

**6.3 Sparse Sampling for Efficiency**

Full pairwise comparison requires O(k²) evaluations per
query---prohibitively expensive. zELO uses sparse sampling to reduce
this to O(k).

**6.3.1 Graph-Theoretic Formulation**

Represent comparisons as a graph G = (V, E) where V = {d_1, \..., d_k}
and (d_i, d_j) ∈ E iff the pair was compared. For accurate ELO
estimation, G must satisfy:

14. Connectivity: G must be connected (otherwise relative ELOs between
    components are undefined)

15. Uniform degree: All nodes should have similar degree (for uniform
    variance in estimates)

16. Low diameter: Maximum path length should be small (error propagates
    along paths)

**6.3.2 k-Regular Graph Construction**

zELO constructs a k-regular graph by unioning k/2 random Hamiltonian
cycles:

*G = ∪\_{c=1}\^{k/2} Cycle_c, where each Cycle_c is a random permutation
of V* (32)

This construction guarantees:

- Exactly k edges per node (k-regular)

- Total edges \|E\| = kn/2 = O(n)

- k-connectivity (removing k-1 edges leaves graph connected)

- Diameter O(log n) with high probability

**Theorem 6** *(Sparse ELO Estimation Convergence)*

> For a k-regular comparison graph with k ≥ 4 on n documents, the MLE
> ELO estimates ê converge to the true ELOs e\* with error \|\|ê -
> e\*\|\| = O(√(log n / k)) with high probability.

Proof sketch: The Fisher information matrix I for the Thurstone model
has entries I\_{ii} proportional to the degree of node i. For k-regular
graphs, all diagonal entries are equal, giving uniform variance. The
off-diagonal structure depends on graph connectivity. Using
concentration inequalities for random graphs, the spectral norm of
(I\^{-1} - I\*\^{-1}) is bounded, giving the stated rate. □

**6.4 Advantages of zELO**

The zELO approach offers several theoretical advantages:

17. No false negatives: There are no \"negative\" labels to be wrong
    about.

18. Continuous supervision: ELO scores provide graded relevance, not
    binary labels.

19. Robust to noise: Individual comparison errors average out in the ELO
    estimation.

20. No Laffer curve: Performance scales with judge quality without the
    diminishing returns of negative mining.

**6.5 Limitations of Pure zELO**

Despite its advantages, pure zELO has limitations:

21. Cost: LLM ensemble evaluations are expensive (\~\$0.01-0.03 per
    comparison).

22. No geometric structure: MSE loss doesn\'t explicitly shape embedding
    geometry.

23. Limited to retrieval: Doesn\'t leverage the inductive bias of
    contrastive learning for embedding models.

These limitations motivate our unified approach, which combines zELO\'s
calibration benefits with contrastive learning\'s geometric benefits.

**7. ANMI 2.0: The Unified Framework**

We now present ANMI 2.0 (Adaptive Negative Mining Intelligence, Version
2), which synthesizes insights from negative mining and zELO into a
unified framework.

**7.1 Design Principles**

ANMI 2.0 is built on five key principles:

**Principle 1: Pairwise Calibration**

Use pairwise comparisons to calibrate difficulty, not to replace
contrastive learning. ELO scores inform negative selection and
weighting, but the training objective remains (partially) contrastive.

**Principle 2: Soft Negative Handling**

Replace binary include/exclude decisions with continuous weighting.
Documents are weighted by confidence in their negative status, allowing
graceful handling of uncertainty.

**Principle 3: ELO Gap as Difficulty Metric**

Use ELO gap from positive (not rank) as the true difficulty metric. This
accounts for varying difficulty across queries and corpora.

**Principle 4: Hybrid Objective**

Combine contrastive and regression objectives. Contrastive loss shapes
embedding geometry; regression loss provides calibration and
regularization.

**Principle 5: Laffer-Aware Boundaries**

Explicitly model the Laffer curve and set adaptive difficulty ceilings.
Don\'t pursue arbitrarily hard negatives.

**7.2 The ANMI 2.0 Pipeline**

The complete pipeline consists of six stages:

**Stage 1: Multi-Retriever Candidate Generation**

Retrieve candidates using multiple retrievers (BM25, dense, ColBERT) and
fuse with Reciprocal Rank Fusion:

*RRF(d) = Σ_r 1/(k + rank_r(d))* (33)

where k is typically 60. This provides diverse candidates covering
different notions of similarity.

**Stage 2: Sparse ELO Estimation**

Construct a k-regular comparison graph and estimate ELO scores using a
distilled pairwise model:

*ê = argmax_e ℓ\_{Thurstone}(e; W)* (34)

The pairwise model is distilled from an LLM ensemble (one-time cost),
enabling fast inference.

**Stage 3: ELO-Gap Based Selection**

Select negatives based on ELO gap from positive, not rank:

| **ELO Gap** | **Category**    | **Weight** | **Action**         |
|-------------|-----------------|------------|--------------------|
| \< 100      | Danger Zone     | 0.0        | Reject             |
| 100-200     | Soft Negative   | 0.5        | Include w/ caution |
| 200-400     | Goldilocks Zone | 1.0        | Full inclusion     |
| 400-600     | Medium          | 0.7        | Include            |
| \> 600      | Easy            | 0.3        | Skip or low weight |

*Table 2: ELO-gap based negative categorization and weighting*

**Stage 4: Pairwise Validation (Borderline Cases)**

For documents in the 80-150 ELO gap range, run direct pairwise
comparison against the positive:

*p = R\_{pair}(q, d\^+, d\_{candidate})* (35)

If p \< 0.65, reject (positive not clearly better). If p ∈ \[0.65,
0.75\], accept with weight 0.3. If p \> 0.75, accept with full weight.

**Stage 5: Training Data Assembly**

Assemble training examples with weighted negatives and curriculum tier
assignments:

*Example = (q, d\^+, e\^+, {(d_i\^-, e_i, Δe_i, w_i,
tier_i)}\_{i=1}\^K)* (36)

**Stage 6: Hybrid Loss Training**

Train using the hybrid loss combining weighted InfoNCE and MSE:

*L = α · L\_{InfoNCE}\^{weighted} + (1-α) · L\_{MSE}* (37)

**7.3 The Hybrid Loss Function**

The hybrid loss is the core innovation enabling synthesis of contrastive
and ELO-based approaches.

**7.3.1 Weighted InfoNCE**

*L\_{InfoNCE}\^{weighted} = -log\[exp(s\^+/τ) / (exp(s\^+/τ) + Σ_i w_i ·
exp(s_i\^-/τ))\]* (38)

where w_i is the ELO-derived weight for negative i. This directly
modulates gradient contributions:

*∂L/∂s_i\^- = (w_i · exp(s_i\^-/τ)) / (τ · Z)* (39)

**7.3.2 MSE on ELO Scores**

*L\_{MSE} = (1/(K+1)) Σ\_{j=0}\^K (g_ψ(f_θ(d_j)) - ẽ_j)²* (40)

where g_ψ is a small prediction head, and ẽ_j = (e_j - μ_e)/σ_e is the
normalized ELO score.

**7.3.3 Gradient Interaction Analysis**

**Theorem 7** *(Hybrid Loss Regularization Effect)*

> For a false negative d_fn with high true relevance, the MSE gradient
> partially counteracts the InfoNCE gradient, reducing net parameter
> update magnitude by a factor depending on the ELO score.

Proof: For document d_fn, the InfoNCE gradient pushes to decrease
similarity (wrong direction), while the MSE gradient pushes to match the
ELO score. If d_fn has high ELO (indicating it\'s borderline), the MSE
target is high, pulling the predicted score up. This creates opposing
gradients:

*∂L/∂f_θ(d_fn) = α · ∂L\_{NCE}/∂f_θ + (1-α) · ∂L\_{MSE}/∂f_θ* (41)

When these point in opposite directions, the net gradient magnitude is
reduced. The reduction is proportional to \|cos(θ)\| where θ is the
angle between the gradients. □

**7.4 Optimal Mixing Coefficient**

The mixing coefficient α controls the balance between contrastive and
regression objectives.

**Theorem 8** *(Optimal Alpha Derivation)*

> Given false negative rate ρ, the optimal mixing coefficient is: α\* =
> (c_3 - c_1) / (c_2 · ρ + c_3 - c_1), where c_1 is the benefit from
> valid negatives in InfoNCE, c_2 is the damage from false negatives,
> and c_3 is the MSE baseline loss.

Practical approximation:

*α\* ≈ 0.8 - 2ρ for ρ ∈ \[0, 0.2\]* (42)

With estimated false negative rate 10%, this gives α\* ≈ 0.6.

**7.5 Curriculum Learning Schedule**

Training proceeds in phases of increasing difficulty:

| **Epochs** | **Minimum ELO Gap** | **Alpha** |
|------------|---------------------|-----------|
| 1-2        | \> 300 (easy only)  | 0.5       |
| 3-4        | \> 200 (+ medium)   | 0.6       |
| 5-6        | \> 150 (+ hard)     | 0.7       |
| 7+         | \> 100 (all tiers)  | 0.8       |

*Table 3: Curriculum schedule for ANMI 2.0 training*

**8. Theoretical Analysis**

We provide rigorous analysis of the ANMI 2.0 framework, establishing
convergence guarantees and characterizing performance bounds.

**8.1 Thurstone MLE Convergence**

We analyze the convergence of the gradient descent algorithm for
Thurstone model fitting.

**8.1.1 Log-Likelihood Concavity**

**Lemma 1** *(Strict Concavity)*

> The Thurstone log-likelihood ℓ(e) is strictly concave on the
> constraint manifold {e : Σᵢ eᵢ = 0}.

Proof: The Hessian of the log-likelihood is:

*H\_{ij} = ∂²ℓ/∂eᵢ∂eⱼ* (43)

For i = j:

*H\_{ii} = -Σ\_{k:(i,k)∈E} φ(Δᵢₖ)²/\[Φ(Δᵢₖ)(1-Φ(Δᵢₖ))\]* (44)

For i ≠ j with (i,j) ∈ E:

*H\_{ij} = φ(Δᵢⱼ)²/\[Φ(Δᵢⱼ)(1-Φ(Δᵢⱼ))\]* (45)

The matrix H is negative semidefinite with kernel spanned by 1 (the
all-ones vector). On the constraint manifold orthogonal to 1, H is
negative definite. □

**8.1.2 Convergence Rate**

**Theorem 9** *(Gradient Descent Convergence)*

> For a k-regular comparison graph, gradient descent on the Thurstone
> log-likelihood with step size η = 1/L converges as: \|\|e⁽ᵗ⁾ - e\*\|\|
> ≤ (1 - μ/L)ᵗ \|\|e⁽⁰⁾ - e\*\|\|, where μ = Ω(k/n) is the strong
> convexity parameter and L = O(k) is the Lipschitz constant.

The condition number κ = L/μ = O(n/k), so convergence is faster for
denser graphs. For k = O(log n), we get κ = O(n/log n), giving
polynomial convergence in O(n/log n · log(1/ε)) iterations.

**8.2 False Negative Damage Bounds**

We characterize the damage caused by false negatives under different
training regimes.

**8.2.1 Pure InfoNCE Damage**

**Theorem 10** *(InfoNCE False Negative Bound)*

> For a false negative d_fn with similarity s_fn and false negative rate
> ρ, the expected damage to the embedding space is: D\_{NCE} = O(ρ ·
> exp(s_fn/τ) / Z), where Z is the partition function.

This shows that damage scales exponentially with false negative
similarity---exactly the hard negatives we seek cause the most damage
when mislabeled.

**8.2.2 Hybrid Loss Damage Reduction**

**Theorem 11** *(Hybrid Loss Damage Mitigation)*

> Under the hybrid loss with mixing coefficient α, the expected false
> negative damage is: D\_{hybrid} = α · D\_{NCE} + (1-α) · D\_{MSE},
> where D\_{MSE} = O(ρ · (s_fn - e_fn)²). When the false negative has
> high ELO (correctly reflecting its borderline status), D\_{MSE} \<\<
> D\_{NCE}, providing substantial mitigation.

The key insight is that the MSE component is \"aware\" of document
quality through ELO scores, while InfoNCE only sees binary labels.

**8.3 Information-Theoretic Analysis**

We analyze the information content of comparisons at different ELO gaps.

**8.3.1 Information per Comparison**

The information gained from comparing documents with ELO gap Δe is:

*I(Δe) = H(Bernoulli(Φ(Δe))) = -Φ(Δe)log Φ(Δe) - (1-Φ(Δe))log(1-Φ(Δe))*
(46)

This is maximized at Δe = 0 (I(0) = 1 bit) and approaches 0 as \|Δe\| →
∞.

**8.3.2 Goldilocks Zone Derivation**

**Theorem 12** *(Optimal Training Gap)*

> The optimal ELO gap for training balances information content and
> false negative risk: Δe\* = argmax\_{Δe} \[I(Δe) - λ · P(false
> negative \| Δe)\], where λ is the damage coefficient. For typical λ,
> this gives Δe\* ∈ \[150, 300\].

This provides theoretical justification for the empirical \"Goldilocks
zone\" observed in practice.

**8.4 Generalization Bounds**

We establish generalization guarantees for models trained with ANMI 2.0.

**Theorem 13** *(Generalization Bound)*

> For a model trained with ANMI 2.0 on n queries with K negatives each,
> the generalization gap is bounded by: E\[L\_{test}\] - E\[L\_{train}\]
> ≤ O(√(d log(nK) / n)) + O(ρ · exp(s_max/τ)), where d is the embedding
> dimension, ρ is the false negative rate, and s_max is the maximum
> negative similarity.

The first term is the standard Rademacher complexity bound; the second
captures false negative damage. ANMI 2.0\'s ELO-based weighting reduces
the effective ρ, tightening the bound.

**10. Discussion**

**10.1 Relationship to Prior Work**

ANMI 2.0 builds on and unifies several research threads:

**Hard Negative Mining**

Work by Robinson et al. (2021) and Xiong et al. (2021) established the
importance of hard negatives, showing 15-20% MRR improvements. Our
framework explains why this works (gradient amplification) and why it
has limits (Laffer curve).

**Pairwise Learning to Rank**

Classical learning-to-rank methods (RankNet, LambdaRank) use pairwise
comparisons directly. We show how to use pairwise information for
calibration while retaining the benefits of modern contrastive learning.

**ELO-Based Evaluation**

The zELO paper demonstrates that LLM ensembles can generate training
data superior to human annotations. We extend this insight to create a
hybrid training framework that combines ELO calibration with contrastive
objectives.

**10.2 Assumptions and Limitations**

Our framework relies on several assumptions:

24. Pairwise model accuracy: The distilled pairwise model must be
    well-calibrated. Miscalibration propagates to ELO estimates and
    training weights.

25. Graph connectivity: Sparse sampling assumes the k-regular graph is
    connected. For very small k, disconnected components can arise.

26. Thurstone noise model: We assume comparison noise is Gaussian.
    Non-Gaussian noise (e.g., heavy tails) may require alternative
    models.

27. Stationarity: The framework assumes the relevance distribution is
    stationary during training. Non-stationary distributions (concept
    drift) require continuous adaptation.

**10.3 Computational Considerations**

ANMI 2.0 introduces additional computation compared to pure negative
mining:

- Pairwise model inference: O(kn) per query for k-regular graph on n
  candidates. With k=6 and n=200, this is 1,200 pairwise model calls.

- ELO estimation: O(kn · iterations) for gradient descent, typically \<
  100 iterations.

- One-time pairwise model distillation: The LLM ensemble annotation cost
  (\~\$7,500 for 250K examples) is amortized over all subsequent
  training.

The pairwise model (22M parameters) runs at \~10ms per comparison on
GPU, making the per-query overhead approximately 12 seconds for ELO
estimation. This is acceptable for offline training but may be
prohibitive for online learning scenarios.

**10.4 Future Directions**

Several extensions merit further investigation:

28. Adaptive graph construction: Rather than fixed k-regular graphs,
    adapt the comparison graph based on initial ELO uncertainty.

29. Online ELO updates: Incrementally update ELO estimates as new
    comparisons arrive, enabling continuous learning.

30. Multi-task ELO: Share ELO estimation across related queries to
    reduce comparison costs.

31. Theoretical tightening: Sharper bounds on false negative damage and
    generalization under specific distributional assumptions.

**11. Conclusion**

This paper has presented a unified theoretical framework for training
reranking models, synthesizing insights from contrastive learning, hard
negative mining, and ELO-based relevance estimation.

Our key contributions include:

32. Theoretical foundation: We derived the contrastive learning
    framework from first principles, establishing the mathematical basis
    for understanding why hard negatives matter and why they can fail.

33. Laffer Curve Theorem: We proved that hard negative mining exhibits
    diminishing and eventually negative returns, establishing a
    fundamental ceiling on pure contrastive approaches.

34. Unified framework: ANMI 2.0 combines the geometric benefits of
    contrastive learning with the calibration benefits of ELO-based
    scoring, achieving the best of both worlds.

35. Sparse estimation theory: We established convergence guarantees for
    ELO estimation from O(n) pairwise comparisons, enabling efficient
    calibration.

36. Hybrid loss analysis: We derived the optimal mixing coefficient and
    characterized the regularization effect of the MSE component against
    false negative damage.

The framework unifies ten foundational principles---contrastive learning
theory, Bradley-Terry models, Thurstone\'s law, information theory,
curriculum learning, ensemble theory, exploration-exploitation, gradient
analysis, spectral graph theory, and regularization theory---into a
coherent approach for training high-quality reranking models.

We believe this unified perspective will enable a new generation of
retrieval model training methodologies that are more principled, more
robust to labeling noise, and more effective at producing high-quality
rerankers for real-world applications.

**Appendix A: Complete Proofs**

**A.1 Proof of Theorem 4 (Laffer Curve)**

We provide the complete proof of the Laffer Curve Theorem.

Let α denote the \"intelligence\" of the negative mining system,
operationalized as the expected similarity between mined negatives and
the query.

Define:

- ρ(α): False negative rate as a function of miner intelligence

- G(α): Expected gradient signal from true negatives

- D(α): Expected damage from false negatives

The expected training benefit is:

*B(α) = (1 - ρ(α)) · G(α) - ρ(α) · D(α)* (A.1)

We make the following assumptions:

37. G(α) is increasing and concave (more intelligent mining finds harder
    true negatives, with diminishing returns)

38. D(α) is increasing and convex (harder false negatives cause more
    damage, with accelerating harm)

39. ρ(α) is increasing (smarter mining retrieves more unlabeled relevant
    documents)

Taking the derivative:

*dB/dα = (1-ρ)G\'(α) - ρ\'(α)G(α) - ρD\'(α) - ρ\'(α)D(α)* (A.2)

*= (1-ρ)G\'(α) - ρD\'(α) - ρ\'(α)\[G(α) + D(α)\]* (A.3)

At α = 0 (random sampling): ρ(0) ≈ 0, ρ\'(0) small, so dB/dα ≈ G\'(0) \>
0. Benefit is increasing.

As α → ∞: ρ(α) → ρ_max (asymptotic false negative rate), and D(α) grows
unboundedly. Eventually:

*ρD\'(α) + ρ\'(α)\[G(α) + D(α)\] \> (1-ρ)G\'(α)* (A.4)

At this point, dB/dα \< 0, and benefit is decreasing.

By continuity, there exists α\* where dB/dα = 0, which is the maximum. □

**A.2 Proof of Theorem 6 (Sparse ELO Convergence)**

We prove the convergence bound for sparse ELO estimation.

Let G be a k-regular graph on n vertices with adjacency matrix A. The
Fisher information matrix for the Thurstone model is:

*I = D - W* (A.5)

where D is a diagonal matrix with D_ii = Σ_j A_ij · c_ij and W has W_ij
= A_ij · c_ij, with c_ij = φ(Δe_ij)²/\[Φ(Δe_ij)(1-Φ(Δe_ij))\].

For a k-regular graph, D_ii = k · c̄ where c̄ is the average curvature
coefficient.

The variance of ELO estimate i is approximately \[I⁻¹\]\_ii. For the
graph Laplacian L = D - W, we have:

*\[L⁺\]\_ii ≤ 1/λ_2(L)* (A.6)

where λ_2 is the second smallest eigenvalue (algebraic connectivity).

For random k-regular graphs, Friedman\'s theorem gives λ_2 ≥ k -
2√(k-1) - o(1) with high probability.

Thus:

*Var(ê_i) = O(1/(k · c̄)) = O(1/k)* (A.7)

Summing over all n vertices and using standard concentration:

*\|\|ê - e\*\|\| = O(√(n/k · log n)) = O(√(log n / k)) when normalized*
(A.8)

This completes the proof. □
