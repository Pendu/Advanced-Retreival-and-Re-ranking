Welcome to the documentation for advanced retrieval and re-ranking research. This resource 
provides a comprehensive overview of the latest techniques and papers organized by their 
role in the RAG pipeline: **Stage 1 (Retrieval)** for efficient candidate selection and 
**Stage 2 (Re-ranking)** for precision scoring.
